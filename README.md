# Localstack SQS consumer serverless

This project showcases the utilization of Localstack's SQS (Simple Queue Service) in a local stage environment. The SQS service of Localstack, enables the creation and management of message queues, providing the ability to simulate the functionality of the corresponding AWS SQS service in a local environment. This allows for the development and testing of applications utilizing SQS without incurring any costs or requiring a live connection to the AWS cloud.

## Usage

### localstack

To start localstack run the following command

```
$ npm run localstack
```

After running this, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Waiting for all LocalStack services to be ready

### sqs

To create the queue of exemple run the following command

```
$ awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name queue
```

After running this, you should see output similar to:

```json
{
    "QueueUrl": "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/queue"
}
```

### deploy
To deploy the lambda functions to the localstack run 

```
sls deploy --stage local
```

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
Using serverless-localstack

Deploying localstack to stage local (us-east-1)
Skipping template validation: Unsupported in Localstack

âœ” Service deployed to stack localstack-local (15s)

functions:
  receive: localstack-local-receive (14 MB)
  send: localstack-local-send (14 MB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
npm run message
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```bash

> localstack@1.0.0 message
> sls invoke -f send --stage local

Using serverless-localstack
{
    "MD5OfMessageBody": "6dc6c8fee18acd1d88e4bde12101c72d",
    "MessageId": "850187ed-dabc-42e6-8bc0-c6e3e62312ff",

        "RequestId": "EAG0GU86Q354NWNBPMHABY0H3ONNXCIYW80UZCHB4QRN9MK1B01V"
    }
}

```

### Logs of receive function

You can see the logs of receive function running

```bash
sls logs -f receive --stage local --startTime 1h
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```bash
Using serverless-localstack
